# Overnight blocker-fix run — 2026-07-17

**North Star:** every quality gate green so the app builds, packages, and runs as a finished product. Fixes executed by `grok` CLI (grok-4.5, reasoning-effort high), verified by the orchestrator re-running each gate.

**Branch:** `feature/ui-rehaul-v2`. WIP safety commit made before any automated edits.

## Gate state at start of run

| Gate | Command | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engine tests | `uv run pytest` | GREEN (~2300 tests, 1 skip) |
| UI tests | `npm run test` (vitest) | GREEN (1015 tests / 107 files) |
| Rust | `cargo check` | GREEN |
| UI typecheck / build | `npx tsc --noEmit` | **RED — 44 errors** (blocks `npm run build`) |
| Engine lint | `uv run ruff check .` | **RED — 103 errors** (52 auto-fixable) |
| Engine types | `uv run mypy` | **RED — 90 errors in 43 files** |

Full error inventories: `docs/progress/gate-tsc-errors.txt`, `gate-ruff-errors.txt`, `gate-mypy-errors.txt`.

## Issue list / checklist

### Batch A — UI TypeScript errors (44) — BLOCKER: breaks `npm run build`
Status: `DONE` — grok run finished, orchestrator re-verified: tsc exit 0, vitest 1015 green, vite build exit 0. Committed 8b89675.
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` violations: lucide icon components passed where `{size?: number}` expected (settings-screen.tsx ×6, dictation-history-screen.tsx ×2, toggle-chip test ×1); style-prop TS2375 in coachmark.tsx, tooltip.tsx, meeting-detected-toast.tsx ×2; payload objects with `| undefined` members (meeting-board-panel.tsx ×2, capture-protocol.ts, library-meeting-detail-pane.tsx)
- Readonly-array mutation: meetings-live-repository.ts `.push` on readonly arrays ×2
- WebSocket factory type mismatch: captions-engine-bridge.ts, meeting-toast-engine-bridge.ts (also `.message` property access on wrong union arm)
- TS2556 spread-argument errors in test files (App__boot-refreshes-devices, wire-meeting-toast-desktop, meeting-toast-view, dictation-pill-view)
- Test fixture shape drift (missing new EngineSettings/onboarding fields): wire-auto-summary, wire-captions-overlay, onboarding-wizard tests ×5, summary-model-section test ×2, transcription-backend-section test
- Unused declarations TS6133: step-features-tour `onContinue`, ask-screen `provider`, home-screen `HelpCircle`/`filterMeetings`, onboarding-wizard `vaultConfigured`
- nav-rail.tsx TS2367 unintentional comparison

### Batch B — engine ruff (103) — MAJOR: CI lint gate red
Status: `DONE` — 53 auto-fixed, remainder by grok run; orchestrator re-verified `ruff check .` exit 0. Includes real bug fix: F821 missing `Path` import in engine/wiring/speaker_enroll_command_dispatcher.py. Committed 8b89675.

### Batch C — engine mypy (90 in 43 files) — MAJOR: CI type gate red
Status: `DONE` — grok run finished; orchestrator re-verified `mypy` exit 0 (461 files), pytest 2173 green. Committed 8b89675.

### Batch D — product-level blockers (from deep scan)
Status: `IN-PROGRESS` — first explore pass returned; three deep Fable sweep agents (UI / engine / Rust+packaging) now confirming and expanding. Confirmed items will be merged below, then dispatched to grok for fixes.

First-pass findings (to be confirmed by Fable sweeps before fixing):
- D1 MAJOR: meeting-toast overlay dual-store split — visibility from main-window meetingDetectionStore vs content from overlay's own WS store; blank-toast risk. (wire-meeting-toast-desktop.ts / meeting-toast-engine-bridge.ts)
- D2 MAJOR: meeting-toast-view.tsx "Keep going" clears only overlay-local state; main window stopHintReason may wedge.
- D3 MAJOR: wire-meeting-toast-desktop.ts swallows invoke() failures silently.
- D4 MAJOR: every new WS connect calls rearm_suggestions_for_ui (websocket_connection_handler.py) — overlay connect re-suggests/churns main stream.
- D5 MAJOR: no UI listens to updater:* events or invokes updater_download_and_install / updater_restart_app — auto-update has no surface.
- D6 MAJOR: tauri.conf.json updater endpoint points at github.com/AlexKapadia/omni — likely wrong repo; auto-update can never succeed.
- D7 MINOR: components/live/meeting-detected-toast.tsx dead in App.tsx after desktop-toast move (tests only).
- D8 MINOR: Cargo.toml doc drift ("updater NOT registered" vs lib.rs registering it).
- D9 MINOR: bundle targets include dmg/app/deb/appimage on Windows-first product.
- D10 INFO (ship logistics, not code): packaged sidecar exe under packaging/dist is stale vs engine (rebuild needed before shipping); updater signing key not wired; Playwright E2E lane + M7 ship checklist still open per docs/progress/omni-build.md.
Refuted by first pass: vite inputs complete (incl. meeting-toast.html); lib.rs registers toast window + 4 commands; capabilities file discovered; detection event names aligned; sidecar path contract OK; dispatchers reachable.

## Agent ledger
| Agent | Brief | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| explore-scan | product-level blocker scan (first pass) | returned, integrated |
| grok batch A | fix 44 tsc errors | done, verified, committed 8b89675 |
| grok batch B+C | fix ruff+mypy | done, verified, committed 8b89675 |
| fable sweep UI | deep UI defect hunt | returned → docs/progress/sweep-ui.md (7 MAJOR, 4 MINOR) |
| fable sweep Rust/pkg | deep Rust+packaging hunt | returned → docs/progress/sweep-rust-packaging.md (6 MAJOR, 3 MINOR) |
| fable sweep engine | deep engine defect hunt | returned → docs/progress/sweep-engine.md (1 BLOCKER, 7 MAJOR, 5 MINOR) |
| grok batch D1 (UI+Rust) | fix all sweep-ui + sweep-rust items per grok-brief-ui-rust-fixes.md | running → grok-run-ui-rust.log |
| grok batch D2 (engine) | fix all 13 sweep-engine items per grok-brief-engine-fixes.md | running → grok-run-engine-fixes.log |

## Resume here (updated)
Both grok fix runs in flight (D1: apps/ui + src-tauri + pyproject; D2: engine/ + tests/ — disjoint scopes, safe in parallel). When they exit: re-verify ALL gates independently (tsc, vitest, cargo check, vite build, pytest, ruff, mypy), spot-check the security fixes (kill-switch in Graph gateway, reveal_path_in_explorer validation), then commit.

## Resume here
If picking this up cold: check gate state table vs reality (`npx tsc --noEmit` in apps/ui; `uv run ruff check .`; `uv run mypy`), then continue with the first non-green batch. Verify after every batch: the fixing agent's word is not evidence.

## Constraints binding on all fix agents
- Never weaken a gate to pass it (no ts-ignore/eslint-disable/type: ignore/noqa unless genuinely unavoidable and justified inline).
- No behavior changes while fixing types/lint; tests must stay green.
- Do not touch `instagram_not_following_back.csv`, `unfollow_*.txt`, `skipped_not_person.txt` (unrelated user files, untracked on purpose).
